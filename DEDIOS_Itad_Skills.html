    <p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>My skills are time management, creativity, critical thinking,
	hand drawing, playing sports such as basketball, and playing games. <sup>2</sup>I'm good at managing my time. <sup>3</sup>Such as 
	doing my things like assignments, playing games, and drawing. <sup>4</sup>I'll set a time for everything I have to do. 
	<sup>5</sup>For me to be less hassle while at the same time having fun. <sup>6</sup>My creativity helps me a lot, such as when 
	Iâ€™m drawing. <sup>7</sup>I don't need a copy to draw. <sup>8</sup>And I can do it freestyle by imagining some art. <sup>9</sup>Using
	imagination and instinct to create something new or to make changes to something that already exists.<sup>10</sup>Exploring new ideas 
	and thoughts. <sup>11</sup>And critical thinking skills allow me to solve problems in my mind and make decisions more effectively.
	<sup>12</sup>If I have a problem, I'll analyze it and determine the best way to solve it. <sup>13</sup>And it helps me since it gives
	me the best things to do. <sup>14</sup>And my hand drawing ain't that bad. <sup>15</sup>Actually, it looks good and nice if I focus 
	on doing some drawing. <sup>16</sup>Since I was a child, I have been practicing drawing skills until the results are satisfying.
	<sup>17</sup>And those are also my skills, playing sports such as basket ball and playing games online. <sup>18</sup>I'm good at
	playing those sports and games, and I'm also happy to see that my skills have improved over time. <sup>19</sup>It's a 
	very satisfying feeling to improve your skills. <sup>20</sup>And doing the best thing I can in order 
	to improve.</font></blockquote></p><br>

	<h2><i><DD><font face="georgia">HOBBIES</font></DD></i></h2>
	<p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>One of my hobbies is playing sports such as basketball, 
	volleyball, badminton, chess, and so on. <sup>2</sup>Since I was a kid, I've enjoyed physical activity. <sup>3</sup>And I'm happy 
	playing with my friend in all those sports. <sup>4</sup>We're always having a competition or a friendly battle. <sup>5</sup>To 
	determine who's number one, it's really fun. <sup>6</sup>So that's why sport has been one of my best hobbies since I was a kid up 
	until now. <sup>7</sup>And the same for an online game. <sup>8</sup>It's really fun to play. <sup>9</sup>And I am always listening
	to music. <sup>10</sup>When I'm alone, it's so nice to relax with music. <sup>11</sup>It gives me a chill and relieves my stress.
	<sup>12</sup>And my favorite themes of songs are love songs, work songs, relaxing songs, and so on. <sup>13</sup>I really love it. 
	<sup>14</sup>It's so nice and good for the ears and mind. <sup>15</sup>And I also love to travel to different places. <sup>16</sup>
	such a place that I haven't seen yet. <sup>17</sup>And take pictures of all the places I've seen. <sup>18</sup>It's one of my 
	hobbies to take pictures. <sup>19</sup>And also, I picture anything that is so cute and beautiful in my eyes. <sup>20</sup>My other 
	hobby is cooking. <sup>21</sup>I love cooking my own food and preparing it for school.</font></blockquote></p><br>

	<h2><i><DD><font face="georgia">INTEREST</font></DD></i></h2>
	<p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>My interest in life is to accomplish my dreams. <sup>2</sup>
	Since I was a kid, I have always dreamed of being a programmer. <sup>3</sup>I am fond of technologies, and whenever there are new
	phones, laptops, tablets, etc. <sup>4</sup>released in the market, I quickly grab and open my phone to see its features and make 
	a judgment about whether it's worth having one or not. <sup>5</sup>Since then, I have enjoyed watching videos on YouTube about 
	technologies because I want to create a unique application someday that I can call mine. <sup>6</sup>Another interest I have in life
	is to explore the world. <sup>7</sup>I want to see the natural beauty that God created for himself. <sup>8</sup>When I'm bored, I 
	immediately go to places that are new to me. <sup>9</sup>For example, traveling to Batangas to have fun at Laiya Beach Resort I 
	remembered that last year, me and my family went there to celebrate my stepsister's birthday. <sup>10</sup>We went underwater, and 
	I saw a lot of different fish dancing in the corals. <sup>11</sup>It's such a wonderful view I've experienced so far. <sup>12</sup>I
	am also interested in cooking. <sup>13</sup>Whenever I'm hungry, I always create an unusual menu that can satisfy my tummy. 
	<sup>14</sup>I enjoyed cooking while experimenting with the food. <sup>15</sup>When I run out of ingredients, I look for alternative
	ingredients that I can use to complete my menu. <sup>16</sup>Fortunately, it always turns out to be a good dish that I and my family 
	can enjoy. <sup>17</sup>My heart flatters when they praise my cooking skills while wearing a genuine smile in front of me.
	<sup>18</sup>Lastly, watching anime and playing online games, and playing sport, are caught my interest ever since I was a kid. 
	<sup>19</sup>It makes me happy, especially when I'm with my friends. <sup>20</sup>They took my burdens and replaced them with joy,
	which made me realize that interest in life provides opportunities for social connection and 
	personal growth.</font></blockquote></p><br>
