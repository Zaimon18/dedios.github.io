    <p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is <strong><i>Zaimon De Dios</i></strong> and I
	was born on the 18 day of February,2003. My biological parents are Filipino but when I was young they 
	got separated. I've been living with my grandmother's place together with my cousins in Nueva Ecija during my childhood
	days. When I'm in my first grade class, I used to leaved the school with my friends going to the river.
	I enjoy catching lot of fish since we're having a friendly competition. The river is clear and beautiful. 
	I was amazed how peaceful it can be and how I see my own reflection when looking into the river. 
	When the sun goes down, I and my friends immediately pack our things to go home. At home, I always help my 
	Grandmother doing the chores. Everytime she go to the market, I always accompany her because I want to help her 
	and I don't want her to carry some heavy things. At night before we sleep, we have this routine to pray before
	we sleep and after we woke up. During weekends, I'll spend my time playing outside with my friends. We
	play filipino games such hide and seek, knock down the can, block and catch and etc in a vacant place near my neighbour house. 
	We also used to go to the nearby computer shop and spend time playing games online. The place becomes 
	noisy when we won the game. People keeps cheering and some were screaming. We have a lot of fun specially
	when we're teasing each other. Seems we get along very well together and that what I love the most when I'm with them.
	They make me smile and it's one of the unforgettable moments there. I hope we can have our reunion 
	someday.</font></blockquote></p><br>
