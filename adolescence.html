	<p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm in my teenage, my father decided to moved me at
	my Aunt's place in Pampanga. At first, I'm scared they might not like me. They seems scary but I was wrong.
	They were actually nice and they are a happy people. While my father busy working abroad, he always find
	time to call me and asks my whereabouts. Eventhough he's a strict dad I can feel his love towards us. The
	school year back then was slowly approaching, my Aunts enrolled me in a private school named Arayat Holy Child. The 
	school looks beautiful though it has some grills surrounds on it. The moment I entered my new school, my hearts beats 
	faster since I don't know what to say to the people who keeps staring at me. As days goes by, I finally made a friend.
	His name is Pierre, he's a hard headed guy and  keeps inviting me to go with him to play online games outside the
	school during ourlunch break. There I met his friend and soon become my friends as well. They are 
	friendly and a happy go lucky people. With them, I somehow remember my friends in Nueva Ecija. Soon 
	after, our vacation came in. My father booked a ticket for me to visit him in Qatar. There I met my 
	stepmother that is caring and nice. They tour us in the nearby areas and have a small talk. Days passed 
	and we have to go back in Philippines since vacation is almost over. I bid my farewell while I holding back my tears.
	My heart feels heavy as I walked away from them.</font></blockquote></p><br>
