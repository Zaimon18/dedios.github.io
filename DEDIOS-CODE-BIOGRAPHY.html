	<h2><i><DD><font face="georgia">CHILDHOOD</font></DD></i></h2>
    <p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>My name is <strong><i>Zaimon De Dios</i></strong> and I
	was born on the 18<sup>th</sup> day of February,2003. <sup>2</sup>My biological parents are Filipino but when I was young they 
	got separated. <sup>3</sup>I've been living with my grandmother's place together with my cousins in Nueva Ecija during my childhood
	days. <sup>4</sup>When I'm in my first grade class, I used to leaved the school with my friends going to the river. <sup>5</sup>
	I enjoy catching lot of fish since we're having a friendly competition. <sup>6</sup>The river is clear and beautiful. 
	<sup>7</sup>I was amazed how peaceful it can be and how I see my own reflection when looking into the river. <sup>8</sup>
	When the sun goes down, I and my friends immediately pack our things to go home. <sup>9</sup>At home, I always help my 
	Grandmother doing the chores. <sup>10</sup>Everytime she go to the market, I always accompany her because I want to help her 
	and I don't want her to carry some heavy things. <sup>11</sup>At night before we sleep, we have this routine to pray before
	we sleep and after we woke up. <sup>12</sup>During weekends, I'll spend my time playing outside with my friends. <sup>13</sup>We
	play filipino games such hide and seek, knock down the can, block and catch and etc in a vacant place near my neighbour house. 
	<sup>14</sup>We also used to go to the nearby computer shop and spend time playing games online. <sup>15</sup>The place becomes 
	noisy when we won the game. <sup>16</sup>People keeps cheering and some were screaming. <sup>17</sup>We have a lot of fun specially
	when we're teasing each other. <sup>18</sup>Seems we get along very well together and that what I love the most when I'm with them.
	<sup>19</sup>They make me smile and it's one of the unforgettable moments there. <sup>20</sup>I hope we can have our reunion 
	someday.</font></blockquote></p><br>

	<h2><i><DD><font face="georgia">ADOLESCENCE</font></DD></i></h2>
	<p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>When I'm in my teenage, my father decided to moved me at
	my Aunt's place in Pampanga. <sup>2</sup>At first, I'm scared they might not like me. <sup>3</sup>They seems scary but I was wrong.
	<sup>4</sup>They were actually nice and they are a happy people. <sup>5</sup>While my father busy working abroad, he always find
	time to call me and asks my whereabouts. <sup>6</sup>Eventhough he's a strict dad I can feel his love towards us. <sup>7</sup>The
	school year back then was slowly approaching, my Aunts enrolled me in a private school named Arayat Holy Child. <sup>8</sup>The 
	school looks beautiful though it has some grills surrounds on it. <sup>9</sup>The moment I entered my new school, my hearts beats 
	faster since I don't know what to say to the people who keeps staring at me. <sup>10</sup>As days goes by, I finally made a friend.
	<sup>11</sup>His name is Pierre, he's a hard headed guy and  keeps inviting me to go with him to play online games outside the
	school during ourlunch break. <sup>12</sup>There I met his friend and soon become my friends as well. <sup>13</sup>They are 
	friendly and a happy go lucky people. <sup>14</sup>With them, I somehow remember my friends in Nueva Ecija. <sup>15</sup>Soon 
	after, our vacation came in. <sup>16</sup>My father booked a ticket for me to visit him in Qatar. <sup>17</sup>There I met my 
	stepmother that is caring and nice. <sup>18</sup>They tour us in the nearby areas and have a small talk. <sup>19</sup>Days passed 
	and we have to go back in Philippines since vacation is almost over. <sup>20</sup>I bid my farewell while I holding back my tears.
	<sup>21</sup>My heart feels heavy as I walked away from them.</font></blockquote></p><br>

	<h2><i><DD><font face="georgia">ADULTHOOD</font></DD></i></h2>
	<p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>As soon as I graduated my Senior High in Arayat, me and 
	my little brother was moved in my Aunt's place in Sampaloc Manila. <sup>2</sup>My aunt's enrolled me in my father's alma mater 
	school named UE. <sup>3</sup>I attended my first college year online since face to face is not allowed brought by pandemic.
	<sup>4</sup>At first it was indeed hard because I am not used to it. <sup>5</sup>I was struggling in my studies since there are 
	times the internet keeps being interrupted. <sup>6</sup>Fortunately I was able to pass my first college year. <sup>7</sup>Currently,
	I'm still pursuing my study in UE to reach my dream. <sup>8</sup>I always wanted to become one of the best programmers around the
	world and to create a program which people can use in their daily life. <sup>9</sup>There, I made a lot of friends. <sup>10</sup>
	People are nice and friendly. <sup>11</sup>When the class ends, I'll make sure to go directly to our house.  <sup>12</sup>And I 
	always spend my time watching anime, videos about programming and issues around the world. <sup>13</sup>Sometimes I'm busy teaching
	my cousins on their studies. <sup>14</sup>When I'm bored, I usually go outside to play outdoor games like basketball with my friends.
	<sup>15</sup>It somehow gives me peace of mind since there are times I am exhausted about the workloads in our school. <sup>16</sup>
	Every Sunday, I always go to church to attend mass to thank God. <sup>17</sup>After the mass ended, I usually go directly to the 
	gym to become physically fit in tondo Manila. <sup>18</sup>There I met great people and they seemed nice. <sup>19</sup>They actually
	guide me when I'm doing or trying new things at the gym. <sup>20</sup>And right now, I'm giving my best to become a good student 
	to achieve my dream. <sup>21</sup>And to make my parents proud and happy that the kid they worked hard to raise is now fully adult
	and has graduated.</font></blockquote></p><br>
