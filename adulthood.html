	<p><blockquote><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I graduated my Senior High in Arayat, me and 
	my little brother was moved in my Aunt's place in Sampaloc Manila. My aunt's enrolled me in my father's alma mater 
	school named UE. I attended my first college year online since face to face is not allowed brought by pandemic.
	At first it was indeed hard because I am not used to it. I was struggling in my studies since there are 
	times the internet keeps being interrupted. Fortunately I was able to pass my first college year. Currently,
	I'm still pursuing my study in UE to reach my dream. I always wanted to become one of the best programmers around the
	world and to create a program which people can use in their daily life. There, I made a lot of friends. 
	People are nice and friendly. When the class ends, I'll make sure to go directly to our house. And I 
	always spend my time watching anime, videos about programming and issues around the world. Sometimes I'm busy teaching
	my cousins on their studies. When I'm bored, I usually go outside to play outdoor games like basketball with my friends.
	It somehow gives me peace of mind since there are times I am exhausted about the workloads in our school. 
	Every Sunday, I always go to church to attend mass to thank God. After the mass ended, I usually go directly to the 
	gym to become physically fit in tondo Manila. There I met great people and they seemed nice. They actually
	guide me when I'm doing or trying new things at the gym. And right now, I'm giving my best to become a good student 
	to achieve my dream. And to make my parents proud and happy that the kid they worked hard to raise is now fully adult
	and has graduated.</font></blockquote></p><br>
